# Decentralized Invoice Verification DApp

## Project Vision
Our vision is to revolutionize the invoicing process by leveraging blockchain technology to enhance trust and transparency between merchants and clients. This decentralized application (DApp) facilitates secure invoice generation and verification, addressing common pain points in financial transactions.

## Features
- **Invoice Generation**: Merchants can create invoices linked to specific Ethereum transaction hashes automatically.
- **Invoice Verification**: Clients can upload invoices to verify their authenticity against the blockchain.
- **User-Friendly Interface**: Built with Next.js and Tailwind CSS for a seamless user experience.
- **Secure and Transparent**: Utilizes Ethereum's blockchain to provide an immutable record of transactions.
- **Audit Ready**: Easy retrieval of invoices for compliance and regulatory requirements.

## Deployment Details
The DApp is deployed on an Ethereum test network and can be accessed via the following links. Ensure you have a wallet configured to interact with the Ethereum network.
